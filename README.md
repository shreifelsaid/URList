This is a web application for an online marketplace within the University of Rochester community. The user is able to create an account using their University of Rochester email address; they will also be required to come up with a password and a security question upon registration. 
The main purpose of the app is to create posts with the items for sale. Each post must include a title, description, price and a picture. Once the post is created, it is visible to all the users. The creator of the post can then edit or delete it.
The user is able to add an item to their "cart". In that case, the item will no longer be available for other users. If the item is removed from the cart, it becomes available again.
Account management includes changing the password and username. To change the password the user will need to use their security question, and to change the username they will need the current password.
If the user forgets their password when trying to log in, they have the option to log in using the security question, and then reset the password.

This web application uses Flask as its web framework and SQLite database. It is installed on the UR Digital Scholar web server.
